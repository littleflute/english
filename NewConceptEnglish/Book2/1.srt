Last week I went to the theatre.

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I had a very good seat.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The play was very interesting.

Idid not enjoy it.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
They were talking loudly.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I got very angry.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I could not hear the actors.

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In the end,I could not bear it.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
'It's none of your business,'the young man said rudely.

17
