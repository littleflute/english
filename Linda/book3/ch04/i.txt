agenda

Ralph's daily agenda includes driving his granddaughter to school, working at the soup kitchen, and walking his dog after dinner.

antidote

Because there was no antidote for the snake's poison, the cat that was bitten died.

For me, a good antidote to feeling low is to bake a batch brownies.
